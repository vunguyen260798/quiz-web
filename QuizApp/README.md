# Quiz App

This is a fully-featured, interactive quiz application built using React.js, designed to be lightweight, scalable, and easily customizable for diverse use cases. The application dynamically renders a series of questions and evaluates user responses in real-time, providing instant feedback on whether the answers are correct or incorrect.

The quiz supports multiple question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, and true/false questions, ensuring flexibility for various types of quizzes, from casual trivia to educational assessments. Users can navigate through the questions seamlessly, with a clear progress indicator that shows how far they've advanced in the quiz.

Upon completion, users are presented with a detailed score summary, including correct and incorrect answers, allowing them to assess their performance. The application is designed to deliver an engaging user experience, featuring responsive layouts, clean animations for smooth transitions, and a visually appealing interface.

Customization is a key focus, with options to easily modify questions, categories, and quiz settings. This makes it suitable for educators, businesses, and developers looking for a quick solution to integrate quizzes into their platforms. Built with scalability in mind, the app can be extended further with features like timed quizzes, leaderboards, or integration with external APIs for dynamic question loading.
